# Two-way set-associative cache

A coursework exercise with the original SystemVerilog design and testbench.

## Run

From this project folder, with ModelSim/Questa on PATH:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/run_sim.ps1
```

On Linux or Git Bash: `bash sim/run.sh`.

The test module is `tb_cache_2way`. Compilation and simulation logs are saved under `reports/`. Read the test output before treating a run as verified: a simulator exit alone is not proof that every check passed.
